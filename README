The iFixit Gear Bag will be an application that allows iFixit users to build a 
collection of devices they own. Device images will be retrieved from the iFixit 
website and displayed in grid format with infinite scrolling. Users will be able 
to drag and drop the devices into a gear bag. The device collection will be saved
to the user's browser using HTML5's SQLite storage engine at the browser's HTML5 
storage layer. The app will be compatible with Google Chrome and Firefox.
